# advent-of-code
A repository for my solutions to the annual "Advent of Code" (AoC) event - see https://adventofcode.com/.

Generally my solutions have been programmed in Clojure, and use Boot to run.

# Running
To use a solution, you will need to change directory into the day/star (e.g. cd day-1/star-1).

In order to run the tests:
```
boot test
```

In order to run the code to print out the solution for the input data:
```
boot run
```

A description of the exercise for the day/star in included in each project.
